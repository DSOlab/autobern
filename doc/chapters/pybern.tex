\chapter{pybern}
\label{ch:pybern}

\emph{pybern}\index{pybern} is the core part of the analysis platform. It is 
actually a Python module (aka a software library) that contains definitions and 
functions used throught the programs used for the processing. Its development 
is performed in the relevant \href{https://github.com/DSOlab/autobern}{github repository}. 
Currently (\today), the servers running the software use (by default) Python 2.7, 
so we must always make sure the module is compatible with this version. However, 
the module should also run without problems with Python 3.x.

\section{Installation}
