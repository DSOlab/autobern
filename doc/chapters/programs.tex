\chapter{Programs}
\label{ch:programs}

In the following we give a brief description of the main programs used to 
implement the GNSS analysis used in the platform. Note that all of the programs 
depend on the \nameref{ch:pybern} module, hence \ul{make sure that you have 
the lastest version of pybern installed} (see \nameref{sec:pybern-installation}).

\section{syncwbern52}
\label{sec:programs-syncwbern52}
\verb|syncwbern52| syncronizes (aka mirrors) a local folder, which should normaly 
be the local \verb|/GEN|\index{GEN} folder, to the (remote) AIUB's \verb|/GEN| folder 
located at \url{ftp.aiub.unibe.ch/BSWUSER52/GEN}. This process 
\ul{excludes all *.EPH files} which are system-dependent, binary file(s).
You can see the help message for more information.

\section{get\_vmf1\_grd}
\label{sec:programs-get-vmf1-grd}
\verb|get_vmf1_grd| downloads VMF1\index{VMF1} grid files to be used in the GNSS analysis 
for troposphere estimation/mitigation. Grid files are downloaded from 
\url{VMF1 grid files from https://vmf.geo.tuwien.ac.at/trop_products/GRID/2.5x2/VMF1}.
The script allows for downloading both final and forecast grid files, but note that 
for the latter you will need \nameref{ch:credentials}. You can see the 
help message for more information.


\subsection{Examples}
\label{ssec:programs-get-vmf1-grd-examples}
Download final VMF1\index{VMF1} grid files, for the date 01/01/2021, merge them (all four) to 
a file named VMF\_01012021.GRD and delete the individual hourly files.\\
\verb|$>get_vmf1_grd.py -y 2021 -d 1 -m VMF_01012021.GRD --del-after-merge|\\
\\

Download (forecast) VMF1\index{VMF1} grid files for today, merge them (all four) to a file 
named VMF\_today.GRD and delete the individual hourly files. This will need credentials 
to access the forecast VMF1 files, see \nameref{ch:credentials}.\\
\verb|$>date +"%Y-%j" ## get year and doy in Unix-like systems|\\
\verb|2021-268|\\
\verb|## call the program with today's date|\\
\verb|$>get_vmf1_grd.py -y 2021 -d 268 -f -c dso_credentials -m VMF_today.GRD --del-after-merge|\\
