\chapter{Credentials}
\label{ch:credentials}

A few scripts/programs need credentials to work properly. Normally, these can be 
provided in one of two ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item pass in the credentials as command line arguments (e.g. \verb|--username=...| \verb|--password=...|), or 
    \item pass in a credentials file (and let the program parse the corresponding credentials)
\end{itemize}

A credentials file containing all widely used usernames, passwords, hosts and various 
other info has been compiled for the needs of this platform. However, this file is 
\ul{not to be published and is not included in the (github) distribution}.
